# GraphQL Backend Optimization with Dynamic Queries

## Overview

This repository contains a solution for optimizing GraphQL backend operations by dynamically generating database queries based on GraphQL requests. The implementation focuses on enhancing efficiency using TypeORM for database interactions.

## Features

- **Dynamic Query Generation:** GraphQL queries are dynamically translated into optimized database queries.
- **TypeORM Integration:** Utilizes TypeORM for seamless interaction with the underlying database.
- **Selective Data Retrieval:** Allows selective retrieval of data based on the requested fields and relations in GraphQL queries.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several components:

- **GraphQL Schema (`schema.graphql`):** Defines the GraphQL types, queries, mutations, and input types.
- **GraphQL Resolvers (`resolvers.ts`):** Implements resolver functions for handling GraphQL queries and mutations.
- **Query Parsing (`ParseGraphqlReq.ts`):** Provides a function to parse the selection set of a GraphQL query, identifying requested fields and relations.
- **Database Entities (`User.entity.ts` and `Education.entity.ts`):** Define TypeORM entities for the User and Education tables.
- **Database Service (`user.service.ts`):** Implements a UserService class to handle database interactions.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your database connection and configuration in `AppDataSource` or your database configuration file.

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

5. Access the GraphQL Playground or endpoint to test queries and mutations.

## Usage

### Case 1: Fetching All Data

Execute the following GraphQL query to retrieve all user data with education details:

```graphql
query Query {
  user {
    id
    name
    address
    age
    education {
      collegeName
      courseName
      level
    }
  }
}
```

### Case 2: Fetching Partial Data without Relations

Execute the following GraphQL query to retrieve partial user data without education details:

```graphql
query Query {
  user {
    id
    name
    address
    age
  }
}
```
